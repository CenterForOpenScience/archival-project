Archival Project
=======

This is a framework for the Archival Project, which aims to code psychological studies' statistics.
It's written using CakePHP.
The code is missing the Config directory, which can be taken from a CakePHP distribution. The code
can probably be adapted to other meta-analysis, but it requires some knowledge of PHP and JavaScript, JQuery
to do so.
